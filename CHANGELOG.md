# 0.11.5

- Ported BTSet to JVM
- BTSet and BTSetIter implement ChunkedSeq
- New benchmark runner

This release brings a significant performance boost for JVM version of DataScript (numbers are in comparison to JS/v8 version):

- queries with single clause, no join: ~5–6 times faster
- queries with joins: ~3–4.5 times faster
- `transact`: ~3 times faster
- `init-db`: ~3–4 times faster
- rules: ~3-4 times faster

# 0.11.4

Experimental support for Clojure on JVM:

  - `sorted-set` instead of BTSet
  - polymorphic `get` lookup in query
  - no sorting optimisation for `init-db`

Performance numbers so far ([raw data](https://gist.github.com/tonsky/9da339f87113e1f1a395)):

- queries with single clause, no join: 30–50% faster 
- queries with joins: ~50% slower
- `transact`: ~3.5–4 times faster
- `init-db`: ~2–2.5 times slower
- rules: ~2–5 times faster
- db `equiv`: ~5 times slower
- db `hash`: ~10 times slower

- Support for nested maps in `transact!` (also fixes #38)
- [ BREAKING ] Custom aggregate fns must be called via special syntax (`aggregate` keyword): `(q '[:find (aggregate ?myfn ?e) :in $ ?myfn ...])`. Built-in aggregates work as before: `(q '[:find (count ?e) ...]`

- `(datascript/datom e a v & [tx added])` call for creating new datoms
- Added missing aggregate funs: `avg`, `median`, `variance`, `stddev` and `count-distinct` (issue #42, thx [@montyxcantsin](https://github.com/montyxcantsin))

# 0.6.0

- New method `init-db` for fast creation of DB from existing datoms (useful for e.g. initialization from serialized state)
- Improved performance of `transact!` (~20%) and initial database population (`init-db`, `db-from-reader`, ~800%)

# 0.5.2

- [ BREAKING ] Javascript namespace is renamed from `datascript.js` to `datascript`

# 0.4.2

- Retract incoming entity references on `:db.fn/retractEntity` (issue #18)
- You can now use reverse relation name when transacting entity as a map

# 0.4.0

Cosmetic changes to better mimic Datomic API. Useful for sharing code between Datomic and DataScript:

- Added `tempid`, `resolve-tempid`, `db`, `transact`, `transact-async`, `index-range`, `squuid`, `squuid-time-millis`
- [ BREAKING ] renamed `transact` to `with`, `with` to `db-with`

# 0.3.1

- Entity’s `touch` call accessible through `datascript` namespace
- Accept sets in entity maps as values for `:db.cardinality/many` attributes

# 0.3.0

Proper entities implementation:

- Entities are now lazy and implement usual Map protocols
- [ BREAKING ] When accessing attribute of `:db/valueType :db.type/ref`, its value will be automatically expanded to entites, allowing for recursive exploration of entities graphs (e.g. `(-> (d/entity db 42) :parent :parent :children)`)
- Entities support backwards navigation (e.g. `(:person/_friends (d/entity db 42))`)

# 0.2.1
